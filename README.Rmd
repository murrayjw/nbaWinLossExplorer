# nbaWinLossExplorer

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The `nbaWinLossExplorer` shiny app was created as part of STA 2453 to demonstrate
building shiny applications for productions. The application itself is used to
explore expected win/loss records for NBA teams.

The application makes use of every game played in the NBA since 1947. A user can
select a number of wins and losses, as well as a plus/minus differential (within a tolerance), and see the final season outcomes for every team who matched those inputs. 

For more detail see the package vignette. 

## Installation
